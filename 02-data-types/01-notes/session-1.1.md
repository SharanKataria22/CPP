# ðŸ“Š Data Types in C++

## ðŸ”¹ What are Data Types?
Data types define the **type of data** a variable can store in C++. It helps the compiler decide:
- How much memory to allocate
- What operations can be performed on the variable

## ðŸ”¸ Basic Data Types in C++

| Type       | Keyword  | Example             | Size (Approx) |
|------------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Integer    | `int`    | `int age = 20;`     | 4 bytes       |
| Float      | `float`  | `float pi = 3.14;`  | 4 bytes       |
| Double     | `double` | `double bigNum = 3.14159;` | 8 bytes |
| Character  | `char`   | `char grade = 'A';` | 1 byte        |
| Boolean    | `bool`   | `bool passed = true;` | 1 byte     |

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion
Data types in C++ are fundamental to building efficient and reliable programs. They define the type of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or boolean values. Understanding the different primitive data types (like int, float, char, bool) and derived types (such as arrays, pointers, and structures) is crucial for selecting the right type based on the requirements of a program.

By knowing how to choose and work with the appropriate data types, you can:

Optimize memory usage.

Improve performance by reducing unnecessary type conversions.

Make your code more readable and maintainable.

Mastering C++ data types sets a solid foundation for handling more complex topics like functions, arrays, and object-oriented programming.
