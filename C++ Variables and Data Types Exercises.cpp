//C++ Variables and Data Types Exercises
//Descriptive Questions:-
	
/*1-What is a variable in C++?
	Define a variable and explain its purpose in C++.
->Veriable is container in C++. In which we stores datas.*/
	
/*2-What data type would you use to store an age in C++?
	Give an example of how to declare and initialize such a variable.
->We use int data type to store an age in C++
	For Example: int age=17 etc*/
	
/*3-What does the int data type store?
	Provide an example
->It stores the Whole numbers Integers numbers.
	For Example:123456789 etc*/
	  
/*4-Explain the difference between float and double data types
->Float and double both are data type in which we stores decimals numbers
	defference b/w them are float contains 6-7 numbers after piont and
	double contains 15-16 numbers after point.*/
	  
/*5-What data type would you use to store a character?
	Provide an example of how to declare and initialize this variable.
->We use char data type to store a character
	For Example:(char grade= A)*/
	  
/*6-What is the default value of a bool variable in C++?
	Provide a short example where true and false values are used*/
	
/*7-Declare a variable x of type int and assign it the value of 10.
-> int x = 10*/
	
/*8-How do you assign one value to multiple variables in C++?
	Provide an example using variables a, b, and c.
->*/
	
/*9-What is the purpose of using the const keyword in C++?
	Write a short example where a constant variable is 
->If we use the const keyword in a dataType then that variABLE is locked
	then we cant modify that variable's value
	For Example: const int x = 5; now this dataType locked.*/
	
/*10-What is the rule for naming variables in C++?
	List at least three naming conventions or rules for valid identifiers.
->(i) cannot use same variable name again.
  (ii) cannot use the space in veriable name
  (iii) cannot use the special characters in veriable name
  (iv) cannot use the numbers/digits in variable name*/
